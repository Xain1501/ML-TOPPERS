# ML Toppers Weekly Assignments

This repository contains my weekly assignments and projects completed as part of the **ML Toppers** training sessions. The initiative is focused on helping university students build a strong foundation in **Machine Learning** and related technologies through hands-on tasks and guided learning.

Each week covers a different set of concepts, ranging from Python programming to advanced deep learning techniques. Assignments are organized in folders by week.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder (e.g., `Week 1`, `Week 2`, ...) contains:

- 📘 Lecture Notes (if provided)
- 📂 Assignments and Notebooks
- 🧠 Practice Problems and Solutions
- 📄 Summary / Learnings (optional)

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is intended to:

- Track and document my weekly progress
- Serve as a personal learning log
- Help others who may want to follow a similar path

---

## ✅ Getting Started

You can explore each week's folder to view and run the notebooks. Most files are in `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) or `.py` format.

---

## 🏅 Certification

This learning path will conclude with a **final project** and certifications based on participation and task submissions.

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **ML Toppers Society** for organizing this initiative and creating an accessible, beginner-friendly journey into the world of Machine Learning.
